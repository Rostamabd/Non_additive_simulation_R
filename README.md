## Simulation based on observed genotype data

- This simulation program guides you how to simulate additive, dominance and epistasis gene action, and combination of them for complex traits using R environment/language

- The simulation script has been used in the following paper published in the GSE (Genet Sel Evol 52, 12, 2020)

Abdollahi-Arpanahi, R., Gianola, D. & Penagaricano, F. Deep learning versus parametric and ensemble methods for genomic prediction of complex phenotypes. *Genet Sel Evol* 52, 12 (2020).

- We employed BayesB method for Genomic evaluation using 10 replications and 5-fold cross-validation

## Run the Simulation

```
> git clone https://github.com/Rostamabd/Non_additive_simulation_R.git
> module load R
> R
> source("Simulation_non_additivity.R")
```
