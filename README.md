# Additive and non-additive simulation in R

## 1. Simulation based on observed genotype data

```
- This simulation program tell you how to simulate additive, dominance, epistasis gene action and combination of them for complex traits using R

- The simulation script has been used in the following paper published in the GSE (Genet Sel Evol 52, 12, 2020)

Abdollahi-Arpanahi, R., Gianola, D. & Penagaricano, F. Deep learning versus parametric and ensemble methods for genomic prediction of complex phenotypes. Genet Sel Evol 52, 12 (2020).
```

## 2. Genomic evaluation method

```
We employed BayesB method for Genomic evaluation using 10 replications and 5-fold cross-validation
